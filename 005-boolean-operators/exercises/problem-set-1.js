/*
    Try to think of these answers before coding and printing them out:

    1. What is the result of: "1" === 1
    2. What is the result of: (3 > 2) === true
    3. What is the result of: (2 ** 2) !== "4"
    4. What is the result of: (true === true) && (false === false)
*/


console.log("1" === 1); // string 1 is not strictly equal to number 1 ("1" === 1)

console.log((3 > 2) === true);

console.log((2 ** 2) !== "4"); // string 4 thats why its getting true. it should be number 4 to become whole false   ("4" !== 4)

console.log((true === true) && (false === false)); // true && true
